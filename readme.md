Here’s a **professional GitHub README** for your SQL project:
**“Online Course Progress Tracker”** — written in the same style as your previous one 👏

# 🎓 Online Course Progress Tracker

A beginner-friendly SQL project that models an online learning platform (like Coursera or Udemy) — designed to practice **foreign keys, joins, subqueries, and views** through a real-world education system example.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project simulates an **e-learning database system**, where students enroll in courses, complete modules, and track their progress.
It provides a practical foundation to understand **database relationships**, **query design**, and **data-driven insights** using SQL.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Learn how to connect multiple tables using **foreign keys**
* Practice **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, and **subquery** operations
* Build a **view** for tracking completed students
* Strengthen SQL fundamentals through real-world use cases

| File Name           | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_tables.sql` | Schema creation for Students, Courses, Modules, Enrollments, Progress |
| `insert_data.sql`   | Sample data for all tables (Oracle-compatible inserts)                |
| `queries.sql`       | Analytical SQL queries for course progress and enrollments            |
| `views.sql`         | Contains view creation for completed students                         |

---

## 🧩 Concepts Covered

* Table relationships (Primary & Foreign Keys)
* `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
* Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`)
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* Subqueries and Views
* Basic data modeling for learning platforms

---

## 📊 Example Queries

* Show completion percentage of each student per course
* Find most popular courses by enrollment count
* Create a view of students who completed all modules
* Count how many modules each student has completed

---

## 💡 Example Insights

* Which students are most active learners
* Courses with the highest engagement
* Module-wise performance breakdown
* Completion trends for each course

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

By building this project, you’ll gain confidence in:

* Understanding **table relationships and constraints**
* Writing **efficient multi-table queries**
* Applying **SQL for analytics and reporting**
* Building **structured, real-world databases**

---

## 🪄 Tools Used

* **Oracle SQL Plus** (for schema creation & querying)
* **GitHub** (for documentation & version control)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can extend this project by:

* Adding **course ratings** and **feedback** tables
* Creating **stored procedures** to auto-update progress
* Visualizing progress analytics using Power BI or Python

## 🏁 Project Outcome

A fully functional SQL-based system representing a **learning platform database**, built entirely with **Oracle SQL** using **hands-on queries, views, and relationships**.
All my **practice queries** and **PDF proof of hands-on completion** are included in the GitHub repository.

Would you like me to make a **LinkedIn post** for this project too (like your Fitness Tracker one — with hook, hiring message, and hashtags)?
